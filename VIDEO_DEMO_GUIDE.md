- **CRITICAL:** Show agents updating in real-time
- Show progress bar moving
- Pause briefly on each agent (2-3 seconds each)
- Show agent cards changing: Pending → Processing → Completed

#### **Step 3: Results (0:50-0:60) - 10 seconds**

**VISUAL:** Switch to Analysis tab, show business metrics

**NARRATION:**

**PAUSE 2 seconds**

> "Try it now at [your-deployment-url] or check out the code on GitHub. Built for the hackathon with LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAI."

**KEY POINTS:**
